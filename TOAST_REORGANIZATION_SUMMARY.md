# Toast Components Reorganization Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ToastProvider Context Error
**Problem**: All toast stories were failing with the error: `Toast must be used within ToastProvider`

**Solution**: Added `ToastProvider` decorators to all toast story files to provide the necessary Radix Toast context.

### 2. File Structure Reorganization
**Problem**: Toast files were scattered across the primitives directory, making it hard to manage related functionality.

**Solution**: Consolidated all toast-related files into `src/components/primitives/toast/` directory:

```
src/components/primitives/toast/
├── index.ts                    # Main exports
├── toast.tsx                   # Radix toast primitives (moved)
├── toaster.tsx                 # Toast container component (moved)
├── use-toast.ts                # useToast hook (moved)
└── specialized-toasts.tsx      # New specialized components
```

## Files Moved
- `src/components/primitives/toast.tsx` → `src/components/primitives/toast/toast.tsx`
- `src/components/primitives/toaster.tsx` → `src/components/primitives/toast/toaster.tsx`
- `src/components/primitives/use-toast.ts` → `src/components/primitives/toast/use-toast.ts`

## Import Updates
Updated all internal imports to use relative paths within the toast directory:
- `specialized-toasts.tsx` now imports from `./toast`
- `toaster.tsx` now imports from `./toast` and `./use-toast`
- `use-toast.ts` now imports from `./toast`

## Story Files Updated
Added `ToastProvider` decorators to all toast story files:

### Files Updated:
- `src/stories/achievement-toast.stories.tsx`
- `src/stories/network-switch-toast.stories.tsx`
- `src/stories/error-toast.stories.tsx`
- `src/stories/transaction-notification.stories.tsx`
- `src/stories/toast-components-showcase.stories.tsx`

### Decorator Pattern Added:
```tsx
decorators: [
  (Story) => (
    <ToastProvider>
      <Story />
      <ToastViewport />
    </ToastProvider>
  ),
],
```

## New Story Files Created

### `src/stories/existing-toast.stories.tsx`
- Demonstrates the existing toast system functionality
- Shows basic toasts, destructive toasts, and toasts with actions
- Includes a comparison between existing and specialized toast systems
- Provides best practices guidance

## Export Structure
The main toast index file (`src/components/primitives/toast/index.ts`) now exports:
- All existing toast primitives and hooks
- All specialized toast components
- All convenience functions

## Usage Patterns

### Existing Toast System (unchanged):
```tsx
import { useToast } from "@/components/primitives/toast";

const { toast } = useToast();
toast({
  title: "Basic Toast",
  description: "Simple notification"
});
```

### Specialized Toast Components:
```tsx
import { useToast, showAchievementToast } from "@/components/primitives/toast";

const { toast } = useToast();
toast(showAchievementToast({
  title: "Quest Complete",
  xpAmount: 150,
  progress: 100
}));
```

## Build Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes (`pnpm tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ Full build completes successfully (`pnpm build`)
- ✅ Storybook runs without errors (`pnpm storybook`)
- ✅ All toast stories render properly with ToastProvider context

## Benefits of Reorganization
1. **Better Organization**: All toast-related functionality is now in one directory
2. **Clearer Dependencies**: Import paths show the relationship between components
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Related files are co-located
4. **Consistent Context**: All toast components now have proper ToastProvider context
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes
6. **Enhanced Documentation**: New comparison stories show both systems working together

## Storybook Navigation
Toast components are now organized under:
- `Components/Toast Components/Achievement Toast`
- `Components/Toast Components/Network Switch Toast`
- `Components/Toast Components/Error Toast`
- `Components/Toast Components/Transaction Notification`
- `Components/Toast Components/Existing Toast System`
- `Components/Toast Components/Showcase`
- `Components/Toast Components/Integration`

All stories now render correctly with proper ToastProvider context and can be interacted with in Storybook.
