# Storybook Import Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: `Failed to resolve import "../src/components/primitives/toaster" from ".storybook/preview.tsx". Does the file exist?`

## Root Cause
When we reorganized the toast components and moved files into the `src/components/primitives/toast/` directory, the Storybook preview configuration was still importing the `Toaster` component from the old location.

## Files Affected
- `.storybook/preview.tsx` - Storybook global configuration

## Fix Applied
Updated the import path in `.storybook/preview.tsx`:

```diff
- import { Toaster } from "../src/components/primitives/toaster";
+ import { Toaster } from "../src/components/primitives/toast/toaster";
```

## Additional Updates
Updated documentation files to reflect the correct import paths:
- `TOAST_COMPONENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Updated example imports

## Verification
✅ **TypeScript compilation passes**: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`
✅ **Storybook starts successfully**: `pnpm storybook`
✅ **All toast stories render correctly**: Verified at http://localhost:6002
✅ **ToastProvider decorators working**: No more "Toast must be used within ToastProvider" errors

## Current Status
- All toast components are properly organized in `src/components/primitives/toast/`
- Storybook preview correctly imports the Toaster component
- All toast stories have proper ToastProvider context
- Both existing and specialized toast systems work seamlessly together
- Documentation reflects the correct import patterns

## Import Patterns Working
### For Application Code:
```tsx
import { useToast, showAchievementToast, Toaster } from "@/components/primitives/toast";
```

### For Storybook Stories:
```tsx
import { ToastProvider, ToastViewport } from "@/components/primitives/toast";
```

### For Direct Component Access:
```tsx
import { AchievementToast } from "@/components/primitives/toast/specialized-toasts";
```

The toast components are now fully functional in Storybook with proper context providers and can be viewed at:
- Components/Toast Components/Achievement Toast
- Components/Toast Components/Network Switch Toast  
- Components/Toast Components/Error Toast
- Components/Toast Components/Transaction Notification
- Components/Toast Components/Existing Toast System
- Components/Toast Components/Showcase
- Components/Toast Components/Integration
